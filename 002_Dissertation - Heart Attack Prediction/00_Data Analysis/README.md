We used two datasets for the experiments the "Heart Attack Risk Prediction" dataset, which includes 8,763 synthetic patient records and 26 variables, and the "Heart Disease Health Indicators" dataset, which at first contained 253,661 synthetic instances with 22 features, and later was reduced to 50,000 instances for the flexibility.
### "Heart Attack Risk Prediction"

The dataset, contains 8,763 synthetic patient records from diverse geographical regions, gives a complete array of features that reflect both medical 
and lifestyle factors, providing a robust foundation for predictive analytics and machine learning 
applications. The 26 variables include demographic details such as age, gender, and income. Also, critical 
medical indicators like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, diabetes status, and family history of 
heart disease. These medical variables are combined by lifestyle factors such as smoking habits, alcohol 
consumption, exercise hours per week, dietary habits, stress levels, and sedentary hours per day. 

### "Heart Disease Health Indicators"

This dataset provides a huge array of health
related indicators, lifestyle factors, and demographic information for a large group of individuals. Initially 
included 253,661 synthetic instances with 22 features and then we reduced it to a sample size of 50,000 
instances to streamline and smooth the analysis. This reduction maintains the dataset's diversity and 
statistical significance, ensuring that the findings remain robust and generalizable.
