### Project Overview

This project focused on building a Machine learning model to predict Monkeypox (MPOX) infection, aiming to reduce the reliance on costly and time-consuming PCR tests. The goal was to develop an accurate, efficient, and inexpensive predictive model that could identify individuals likely to have contracted the virus without needing a PCR test.

### **Process**

1. **Data Understanding**: Utilized a dataset containing historical PCR test results, with features like age, symptoms (e.g., sore throat, oral lesions), and HIV infection status etc.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Addressed missing values, corrected data types, and transformed variables for analysis. Key preprocessing steps included converting categorical variables into numerical formats and managing outliers.
3. **Modeling**:
    - Logistic Regression (LR)
    - Decision Tree (DT)
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM) with RBF kernel
    - Naïve Bayes (NB) Models were optimized using GridSearchCV and pre-pruning techniques to enhance performance.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:**

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:
