### Project Overview

This project aimed to investigate the experiences of electric motorcycle owners using social media data. The focus was on analyzing discussions surrounding **Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire** model. By using **Text Mining techniques**, this project sought to understand the opinions, sentiments, and key themes expressed by electric vehicle owners, providing valuable insights into the industry.

### **Process**

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered social media data using **YouTube Data API** and **Reddit API** to collect comments and posts discussing Harley-Davidson’s LiveWire. Search terms included keywords like "Harley-Davidson LiveWire" and "electric motorcycle review."
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the data by removing duplicate comments, special characters, and irrelevant information. Stored the data in structured formats (CSV) for further analysis.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Identified common words, phrases, and discussion patterns using Python libraries. Visualized the frequency of key terms such as "bike," "electric," and "LiveWire," providing an understanding of popular topics.
4. **Text Mining Techniques**: Applied **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for topic modeling and **VADER Sentiment Analysis** to uncover the sentiment behind discussions. Topics ranged from general experiences with electric motorcycles to pricing concerns and performance considerations.

### **Results**

- **Common Themes**: Discussions frequently focused on **performance**, **battery life**, and **pricing** of electric motorcycles.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: The overall sentiment was **slightly positive**, with enthusiasm for electric motorcycles’ benefits but some negativity concerning high prices.
- **Key Discussions**: Topic modeling identified themes like preferences for specific models, discussions on battery technology, and comparisons with traditional motorcycles.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NLTK (for sentiment analysis)
- **APIs**: YouTube Data API, Reddit API for data extraction
- **Text Mining**: LDA for topic modeling, VADER for sentiment analysis
