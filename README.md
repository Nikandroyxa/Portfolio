# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! 

I have worked on various Data Science Projects, where I have used **Python**, **SQL**, **Data Preparation**, **Data Cleansing**, **Data Warehousing**, **ETL**, **EDA** and **Machine Learning** libraries like **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pycaret**, **Catboost**, **XGBoost**, **Scipy**, **NLTK**. 

I have worked in real life scenarios such as building **Predictive Models** for **Heart Attack Prediction** and **Monkeypox Screening** and conducting **RFM Segmentation** and **Clustering** in customer segmentation where I've applied advanced techniques like **Grid Search Cross-Validation**, **DBSCAN Clustering**, and **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**. Iâ€™ve also worked with **APIs** and **Text Mining** tools to analyze social media data, and SQL for data management and analysis in large-scale competitions such as LEGO Education of Greece.
