### **Data Privacy Projects**

This repository showcases two self-initiated data privacy projects inspired by real-world use cases from companies like Datavant. Both projects demonstrate hands-on application of privacy-preserving techniques, data anonymization, and population-level risk analysis using real datasets.

####  **1. Heart Disease Dataset Anonymization**

Applied privacy-preserving techniques (k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness) to the UCI Heart Disease dataset to reduce re-identification risk while maintaining data utility. Focused on generalizing quasi-identifiers and evaluating group-level privacy metrics to meet industry standards.

- **Techniques**: Data Generalization, k-Anonymity, l-Diversity, t-Closeness  
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Goal**: Protect sensitive health information in structured demographic datasets

####  **2. US ZIP Code Population & Privacy Analysis**

Analyzed US ZIP code population and land data to detect ZIP3 code inconsistencies, calculate population density, and explore privacy risks in sparsely populated areas. Visualized population distributions and compared ZIP5 vs ZIP3 aggregations from a privacy perspective.

- **Topics**: Spatial Aggregation, Population Density, ZIP Code Overlaps  
- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Goal**: Identify generalization boundaries and evaluate privacy at geographic levels
